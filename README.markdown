# photosetGrid

A simple jQuery plugin to arrange images into a flexible grid, based on Tumblr's photoset feature.

Originally the photosetGrid was designed for and used in our Style Hatch premium Tumblr themes, but now the plugin has been expanded for use on any site outside of Tumblr.

_This is currently a work in progress while we transition our theme specific code to something that anyone can use._
